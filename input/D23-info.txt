Demonstrate how to extract From, Subject, and Body of emails using the Get IMAP Mail Messages activity and store it in a CSV file 

Insert a Build Data Table in the designer panel. Click on the Data Table button within the activity. In the pop up window, create three columns with headers as Subject with Data Type as String, From with Data Type as String, and Body with Data Type as String. Go to the Properties panel of this activity and in the DataTable property, hit Ctrl+K and enter a new variable called dt_GetMails.
Insert a Get IMAP Mail Messages activity in the designer panel. Go to its Properties panel. In the MailFolder property, enter “Inbox”. In the Port property, enter 993. In the Server property enter “imap.gmail.com”. In the Email property, enter your email address in double quotes and in the Password property, enter your password in double quotes. Ensure that the OnlyUnreadMessages property is unchecked. It will fetch all emails regardless of their Read status. In the Top property, enter 5. In the Messages property, hit Ctrl+K and enter a variable newMessages.
If using Gmail username and password, then allow Google Account for less secure apps and devices. Do this by visiting the Security tab under your Google Account page.
Insert a For Each activity below the Get IMAP Mail Messages activity. Replace the text “item” from the first text box with “mail”, and in the adjacent text box enter the variable newMessages.
